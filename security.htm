      <h3><b>Security Feature</b></h3>
    
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>The security of information/knowledge is essential to its effective exploitation or use. As
knowledge expands, the need to organize it and to provide adequate security becomes more
pressing. This study describes how the information bearing materials of the library can be
secured using traditional and electronic measures. Literature were reviewed on the concept of
information resources security, features of a good security measures (traditional and electronic),
Securing the library resources traditionally, securing the library using telecommunication,
benefits of securing the library resources, problems associated with the use of electronic security
system in the library, and ways of solving problems with the use of electronic security system in
the library.</p>

<p> information security is necessary to ensure that information bearing materials or
documents (electronic or physical) are genuine (Thomas and Teufel, 2003). It is also important
for authenticity to validate that both parties involved in the exchange of information and
information bearing materials are who they claim to be. Some information security systems
incorporate authentication features such as "digital signatures", which give evidence that the
message data is genuine and was sent by someone possessing the proper signing key.</p>

<p>Electronic access technology is the best system for controlling access to library building,
facilities, resources and rooms. Authorized people are allowed to enter a controlled area by
automatically unlocking of the door. Plastic access cards are inexpensive and software can be
programmed to restrict access to certain areas while recording the time, date and location of
authorized and unauthorized access. For extra security, access
control can be used in conjunction with video surveillance to control and monitor large
collections and equipments. </p><p>Access cards can be integrated as photo ID cards for library
employees and can be used as temporary keys for library clientele to have access to restricted
areas. The access system can also be used for monitoring employee time and attendance, security
patrols of the property and can limit access to sensitive areas, information or equipment.</p><p>
Electronic access control system enhances safety and protects valuable library assets. Access
control solution range from simple authorized access systems to advanced close circuit
monitoring and exception reports delivered through secure internet connections.</p><p> The most
popular types of cards is the magnetic strip cards, which looks like a credit card and carries two
or more tracks of information on the magnetic stripe, these can be used for access control and
other services. The proximity card is more expensive but is also more
durable an easier to use. For internal use, a close range type is used; for car parking entrance, a
longer range of up to one yard or so is possible. Proximity card readers can be hidden behind a
wall surface for aesthetic purposes, with just a marker on the wall. Other available card readers
include bar code readers and RFID readers.</p><p>
 Entry keypads can also be included within access control system for entry
without a card or in addition to the card. Biometrics entry systems are available included
fingerprint recognition, palm recognition, and scanning system for high security measure.</p>
