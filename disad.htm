      <h3><b>Disadvantages of e-Resources</b></h3>
    
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Now, more and more people prefer e-resources to traditional ones, because it can save their time and money. However, with various e-resources flooded in, more and more people are aware of the disadvantages of e-resources.</p>
<p>	a) The fact that, e-resources require special devices or personal computers can be looked as a disadvantage. Many e-resources are typically produces to be compatible for certain software which in turn may be not easily available. Since e-resources are dependent on other equipments, certain hardware or software failure may affect it. Unless the hardware, Internet connection or battery power that is required by an e-resource reader is readily available, then its electronic document is useless. In addition, e-resources depending on hardware and software and are more easily damaged than a printed book.<br>
	b) E-resource reading devices are surely more expensive than printed books. All devices of e-resources require power. There is a growing concern that the e-resources at present may not be accessible or compatible to the futureS e-resources software or devices.<br>
	c) Screen glare and eyestrain are a serious concern for many potential users of e-resource technology. A major worry of reading from an e-resource reader could hurt the eyes. The display resolution of computer screens and electronic devices is considerably less than the print quality produced by a printing press.<br>		
	d) Reading from a computer lacks the familiarity and comfort of reading from a book. A paper book can be opened and flipped; through, while an electronic text is more difficult to navigate.<br>
	f) Many titles that are available in traditional print books are not yet  available in an electronic book format.<br>
	g) New technologies always require time, experience, and money in order to  take full advantage of its capabilities.<br></p>
<h3><b>Issues of e-Resources</b></h3>
<p>	a. Licensing: E-Resources need the license from the published to the library for making use of it.<br> 
	b. IPR: E-Resources can be easily copied and forwarded to the another person so librarian should be alert about IPR(Intellectual Property Rights)<br> 
	c. Standards of metadata: There are standards for metadata description like MARC21 but the available e-resources in the market are not standardizing by MARC21.<br> 
	d. Low budget: Libraries are non-profit organization so they cannot purchase and afford the costly electronic resources. <br>
	e. Skill manpower: to handle the electronic collection the proper skills are required among the staff but libraries are lacking of skill manpower. <br>
	f. Lack of infrastructure: Electronic collection is supported by Information and communication Technology components. <br></p>
