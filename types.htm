      <h1>WORLD WIDE WEB</h1>
      <p align="justify"><b>The World Wide Web is a system of
interlinked hypertext documents accessed via
internet. With a web browser one can view web
pages that may contain text, images, videos and
other multimedia and navigate between them via
hyperlinks. The World Wide Web had a number of
differences from other hypertext systems that were
available before it. The Web required only
unidirectional links rather than bidirectional ones.
This made it possible for someone to link to
another resource without action by the owner of
that resource. It also significantly reduced the difficulty of implementing web servers and
browsers. Viewing a web page on the World Wide
Web normally begins either by typing the URL of
the page into a web browser or by following a
hyperlink to that page or resource. The web
browser then initiates a series of communication
messages, behind the scenes, in order to fetch and
display it.</b>

Discs are made from a 1.2 mm thick disc of
polycarbonate plastic, with a thin layer of
aluminium to make a reflective surface. CDROMs
are popularly used to distribute computer
software, including video games and multimedia
applications, though any data can be stored. Some
